# roadtrip

Roadtrip is an app, that makes your roadtrip relying on the power of the magic random algorithm. And it is pretty easy: you just specify the start point of your trip, 
amount of places, desired distance and enjoy the most unpredictible routes generated by this app. As we know, the big road starts from the small step:)

For now app is made up in form of telegram bot: https://t.me/theroad66bot .
